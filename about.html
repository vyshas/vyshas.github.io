        <div class="about-section">
            <p>I am a passionate filmmaker with a unique blend of creative storytelling and technical expertise. After more than a decade leading engineering teams in the tech industry, I made the bold decision to follow my true calling—filmmaking. This diverse background gives me a distinctive edge, allowing me to seamlessly merge the artistic and operational aspects of film production.</p>

            <p>My journey into filmmaking wasn’t just a career shift; it was a leap of faith. While I had spent years studying films independently, my formal training began with a film editing course at City Academy, London. Seeing my relentless passion—some might call it madness—my wife became my greatest supporter, encouraging me to take the plunge. With our 1.5-year-old son, her unwavering belief in me, and just enough savings to last three years, I left my tech career in London to pursue a two-year filmmaking course at Westford Institute of Film Technology, Kochi. There, I refined my skills in direction, scriptwriting, and production while building a network of like-minded filmmakers who shared the same creative obsession.</p>

            <p>My technical background has been a powerful asset in managing complex productions, navigating modern filmmaking technology, and leading diverse creative teams. This unique synergy of creativity and precision was instrumental in my latest film, <strong>Shahaba</strong>, which won multiple awards, including Best Film, Best Script, and Special Jury for Actress. These accolades reinforced my belief in the power of visual storytelling to create meaningful connections and spark important conversations.</p>

            <p>Beyond the camera, I am constantly exploring new narrative techniques, dissecting different filmmaking styles, and collaborating with other creatives. Being fluent in multiple languages allows me to craft universal stories that transcend cultural boundaries, resonating with audiences on a deeper level.</p>

            <p>For me, filmmaking is more than just storytelling—it’s a relentless pursuit of truth, emotion, and human connection.</p>
